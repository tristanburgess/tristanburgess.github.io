## [Rusty DNS Server](https://github.com/tristanburgess/rusty_dns_server)
- This will become a very minimal DNS resolver to aid in teaching myself and my team more about DNS internals.

## [Github's Game Off 2018](https://github.com/andrewburgess/game-jam-2018)
- Created a Space Invaders + Tetris mashup game with my brother using the Phaser game engine.
- See [here](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018/rate/335731) for the project submission page.
