# Worklog

### Currently only tracking non-code (non-committed) work
### Please note that you will need to sign in to [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/) with a Microsoft account before viewing notes/exercises links. I am currently seeking an alternative solution, but this is currently the only method I can provide due to sharing limitations inherent to OneNote.

  - [Elements of Computing Systems](/books.md#Nisan-Elements-Of-Computing-Systems)
    - [Ch 1.1 - Boolean Logic - Intro](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=AC2B7FCAC9B0E0F1%21126621&authkey=%21AFFOZkfzpTODL7A&page=View&wd=target%28nand2tetris.one%7C7023e437-ae5b-224e-aae5-96f701e767a5%2F1.1%20Background%7C38e70493-4de6-45f0-9672-c0f6dbf5d153%2F%29&wdorigin=703)
        - Finished background notes, sections on HDL and hardware simulation, how hardware may actually be built and how software is used to reduce cost and increase efficiency in developing hardware.
    - [1.2 - Boolean Logic - Specification](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=AC2B7FCAC9B0E0F1%21126621&authkey=%21AFFOZkfzpTODL7A&page=View&wd=target%28nand2tetris.one%7C7023e437-ae5b-224e-aae5-96f701e767a5%2F1.2%20Specification%7C756cdf07-ac7d-494e-a2c1-e9f1ed6143e1%2F%29&wdorigin=703)
        - Laid out details of how individual gates work logically/at an interface level, in preparation for doing project 1 of actually building out various logic gates. Covered multi bit input and multi way input versions of elemetary gates.

  - Work's been really busy, so getting started into the swing of things has been slow going. I'm going to find 30 minutes each day for this though, as this is a marathon effort.
  - Kept it fairly easy, got many book prefaces out of the way as a primer

        - Started notes on Chapter 1, working through the basics on boolean algebra and roughly how it is implemented by computing hardware. Touching on some of the basics of interface vs implementation and the like.

  - Clean slate!
