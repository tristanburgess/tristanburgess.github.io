# Worklog

### Currently only tracking non-code (non-committed) work
### Please note that you will need to sign in to [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/) with a Microsoft account before viewing notes/exercises links. I am currently seeking an alternative solution, but this is currently the only method I can provide due to sharing limitations inherent to OneNote.

# 6/7/2020
  - Clean slate!
