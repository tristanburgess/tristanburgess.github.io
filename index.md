**Me: Tristan Burgess**

Hello, that's me up there, Tristan.

I have a strong interest in computer architecture, systems programming, math, physics, game engine technology, and in general: solving problems whether individually or collaboratively.

- Initially, this page is mainly to keep track of a [worklog](/worklog.html) and [notebook](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AvHgsMnKfyush90dUU5mR_OlM4MvsA?e=UaYSOc)
for all my non-code work. This includes notes and solutions to problems from [books](/books.html), [classes](/classes.html) and [articles, research papers, etc](/articles.html) that I'm working through. My main focuses right now are to get a large, breadthy base of knowledge about computer science fundamentals, math, physics, systems programming, and computer architecture things that will help improve my low-level programming abilities. After which, I hope to become an active open source contributor on a project where I can further develop those skills.

- Any projects I do for experimental and/or development purposes outside of any particular class or book will be captured on the [projects](/projects.html) page.

- My brother and I decided last November to get a simple game together for [Github's Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018).
  This is the first game jam for both of us, and my first non-toy project using a pre-existing game engine. So far, it's been a good exercise in learning what different types of game engine systems are typically in orchestration for a game, and how those systems directly affect the content development and orchestration for the actual game code. Since I have interest in working on game engine systems, it made a lot of sense to first become a user of existing systems in making an actual game.

  Out of 328 entries, we came in 46th overall. Not bad for a first try :)
